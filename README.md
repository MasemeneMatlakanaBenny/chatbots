#  Chatbots

The **Chatbots AI Projects** is a series of my reading with **Hands on Large Langauge Models ** where I mainly use HuggingFace Models and Gradio to build chatbots
This project includes **data collection** and **AI automation** .Perhaps somedays I am just lazy to read articles I come across and I can just enter the link in my chatbots 
where I get all I need to know i.e **summarization and answers whenever asking questions**.

## Motivation
We live in a world we AI has become part of our workflow and we can shorten long tasks . Although reading is essential to humans,for long texts ,we may miss
some of the important information we came across. Hence with these chatbots,I get a summary of what I have been reading in my articles and I get to ask questions based on the 
text .The text can be either a social media from platforms such as LinkedIn,X and Facebook even as far as Wikipedia ,I get to summarize and ask questions
